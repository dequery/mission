# Mission

## Goal

Create a decentralized question and answer market place.

## Why

Dequery believes that protocol value should accumulate towards the users of the platform not the platform itself. Current question and answer web apps (such as Quora) don't directly reward currency to users who create questions or answers that the community finds useful. Overtime this gives more power to the app to manipulate users instead of users manipulating the app. Dequery wants users to go down the rabbit hole of thinking together as uninhibited as possible by the platform used to communicate. 

## Technology Choices

Blockchain backed smart contracts to maximize transparency and minimize manamgemnt. Exact architecture still in the works, email info@dequery.org with any thoughts. 

"Whereas most technologies tend to automate workers on the periphery doing menial tasks, blockchains automate away the center. Instead of putting the taxi driver out of a job, blockchain puts Uber out of a job and lets the taxi drivers work with the customer directly." - Vitalik Buterin
